Project that explores the optimization of two unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means and FLoyd-Warshall).
Main objective of the project is to understand deeply how memory is distribuited and the usage of the private caché for each core in a multicore machine.
To get to this goal, the codes make a use of OpenMP functionalities as well as code-based optimizations.

This is still a draft, it is expected to have all the documentation and coding done by the 15th of Feb 2026.

Currently, most of the documentation is in Spanish, it is being translated to English, hopefuly it will be fully in English for the end of the project. :)
